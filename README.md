## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process
I decided to do this completely from scratch - no libraries or frameworks.

I started with the flipping time segments first.  Then on implemented inline svg (for the text) so I can better emulate those old clocks.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Vanilla JavasScript

### What I learned

The usefulness of front end frameworks (such as Vue or React) was reinforced.
